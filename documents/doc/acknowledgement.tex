\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Prof. Ken Wakita for the continuous support of my Master study and research, for his patience, motivation, enthusiasm, and immense knowledge. I could not have imagined having a better advisor and mentor for my master study.

Besides my advisor, I would like to thank my fellow labmates for the stimulating discussions, and for all the fun we have had in the last two years. 

Last but not the least, I would like to thank my parents, for supporting me spiritually throughout my life.
