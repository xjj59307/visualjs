\chapter {System Proposal}
\label {System Proposal}

To solve the problems mentioned in last chapter, our system used traversal-based method \cite{729554} to traverse the object. A new declarative language called VisualJS is created so that this approach can be oriented to JavaScript. On top of this, we proposed a mapping mechanism from an object to visual shapes. Making use of the mapping relationship, our system is able to visualize the object in kinds of shapes and animate these visual shapes automatically while stepping through program. Note that instead of providing rich kinds of data structure visualizations, our research intends to help users visualize and animate the objects that they are interested in.

\section {The Design of VisualJS}
The traversal-based approach takes a root object and traverse the objects by following any other objects referenced by the root. A set of predicates aligned in a pattern will be applied to the object and decide which action to execute. Each action describes its rules about how to generate visual nodes and which objects to traverse as follows.

The declarative language is written in text file. Each file describes only one data structure, which means you have to write code for objects with different structures in respective files. Each file is made up of one pattern and several actions.

The guiding principles that were considered when we designed this system are as follows:
\begin {enumerate}
\item \textbf {Expression Power:} The topology relationship of visual shapes should be specified clearly, naturally, intuitively, and concisely.
\item \textbf {Flexibility:} Flexibility provides the design with root to extend. More data structures and sophisticated visual attributes would be supported in the future. All these requirement changes should be considered in initial design. 
\end {enumerate}

\subsection {Data Model}
Although this system is constructed based on JavaScript, it theoretically suits all object-oriented programming languages like C++ and Java and any other programming language in which an object is constructed in a recursive way, which means an object is composed of other primitive type values or objects. Hence the object can be traversed and matching actions can be executed to generate the topology of visual nodes.

\subsection {Pattern}
A pattern aligns a series of predicates to be matched when object comes. Each predicate has its pair action. The first action whose predicate is matched will be executed. We will elaborate pattern by showing its grammar in EBNF as follows:

\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{0.8\linewidth}
    \begin{grammar}
      <pattern> ::= pattern-name \textbf{: pattern \{} <pattern-body> \textbf{\}}

      <pattern-body> ::= <exec-clause> \{\textbf{,} <exec-clause>\}

      <exec-clause> ::= \textbf{exec} action-name [<when-clause>]

      <when-clause> ::= \textbf{when (} expression \textbf{)}
    \end{grammar}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}

Each pattern starts with a name and a pattern keyword split by a colon, where the keyword is used to differentiate from action in that there is no decided order. After the pattern keyword, a pattern-body surrounded by a pair of braces aligns several exec-clauses. Each exec-clause describes a predicate statement to evaluate and according action will be executed when the predicate is true. The when-clause is optional, and according action will be executed anyway if the when-clause is omitted. All clauses after the one without the when-clause will be ignored in that only the first action passing the predicate will be executed.

The predicates can be written in arbitrary expressions that can be evaluated in current program state of the target program, and a variable called self is created to reference the object being traversed. Predicates written in arbitrary JavaScript code provide strong expression power. It enables users to match the object in rich means. For example, the object can be matched by its type:

\begin{lstlisting}
primitive_value: pattern {
  exec number_action when (typeof self === 'number'),
  exec string_action when (typeof self === 'string'),
  exec object_action when (typeof self === 'object'),
  ...
}
\end{lstlisting}

The object also can be matched by its class:

\begin{lstlisting}
object: pattern {
  exec array_action when (self instanceof Array),
  exec tree_action when (self instanceof Tree),
  exec graph_action when (self instanceof Graph),
  ...
}
\end{lstlisting}

Furthermore, users can specify arbitrary constraints on the fields. The predicate to match an instance of Point class where the the field x is positive and the field y is non-zero: 

\begin{lstlisting}
point: pattern {
  exec point_action when (self instanceof Point &&
                          self.x > 0 &&
                          self.y != 0),
  ...
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection {Actions}

Along with a pattern, one must specify a series of actions that can be executed when the evaluation result of according predicate is true. One action is made up of create actions and next actions. Create actions are used to create visual nodes. Each action creates only one visual node represented with a set of attributes, which are name and value pairs describing the node. For example, a node could be customized by label and shape. The specific types of visual nodes and their attributes will be described in the next section. Next actions are used to indicate the objects to be traversed next. Next actions have two modes to support both object literals and arrays. To traverse arrays, we provide foreach statement. The grammar of actions is showed in EBNF as follows:

\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{0.8\linewidth}
    \begin{grammar}
      <action> ::= action-name \textbf{: action \{} <action-body> \textbf{\}}

      <action-body> ::= <action-clause> \{\textbf{,} <action-clause>\}

      <action-clause> ::= <create-clause> | <next-clause>

      <create-clause> ::= \textbf{create} [environment-var \textbf{=}] node-name \textbf{(} <attribute-clause> \{\textbf{,} <attribute-clause>\} \textbf{)}

      <attribute-clause> ::= attribute \textbf{=} expression

      <next-clause> ::= <object-clause> | <foreach-clause>

      <object-clause> ::= \textbf{next} expression \textbf{(} <environment-clause> \{\textbf{,} <environment-clause>\} \textbf{)}

      <foreach-clause> ::= \textbf{foreach\_next} \textbf{(} <environment-clause> \{\textbf{,} <environment-clause>\} \textbf{)}

      <environment-clause> ::= environment-var \textbf{=} expression
    \end{grammar}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}

Like predicates described in patterns, the values of attributes and environment variables can be either arbitrary expressions written in JavaScript or other visual nodes created previously. For example, a binary tree can be visualized with pretty simple visualjs code. The data structure of the binary tree and the visualjs code is shown as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
{
  "value": <number>,
  "left" : <tree node>,
  "right": <tree node>
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
tree: action {
  create node=tree_node(label = self.value),
  create tree_edge(from = parent, to = node),
  next self.left(parent = node),
  next self.right(parent = node)
}
\end{lstlisting}

Besides those data structures defined in object literals, we could also visualize an array of integer elements in a bar chart. The visualjs code is shown as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
array: action {
  foreach_next()
}

element: action {
  create bar(value = self)
}
\end{lstlisting}

Two actions are defined here. The first one is for traversing the array, and the other one is for visualizing a separate element.

\subsection {Environments}
When traversing an object, it is often useful to pass along state information from one object to its descendant objects. Therefore, we introduced environments. Environments keep a set of variables storing visual nodes or primitive values. Environments can be created in next actions and passed along to subsequently traversed objects.

\subsection {Layouts}
Once a set of visual nodes is created from a traversal of an object. It will be sent to the client and rendered by a particular layout manager of provided by D3.js. The attributes like label and color will be displayed.

Currently, the system only contains layout managers for trees and bar charts, with more are to be added. Each of these layout algorithms use default settings of D3.js, so we do not elaborate the layout algorithms in the paper.  

\section {From An Object to Visual Shapes}
To generate valid data structure visualization and animation, we must at first prove the consistency between the program and visualization. A program is composed of a series of instructions which are executed orderly. Under the control of debugger, program is being paused until step requests come. Every time the program pauses, it represents a new program state. 

What need to be proved is that the initial program state is being correctly visualized and every time the new program state is generated, the animation will respond to it correctly. However, program state contains too much information. A computer program stores data in variables, which represent storage locations in the computer's memory. Program state contains all contents of these memory locations. In contrast, users always have limited interest and perception at a time. We intend to help users understand the program from any angel he is interested in. Instead of visualizing the whole program state like Heapviz \cite{Aftandilian:2010:HIH:1879211.1879222}, this system always focuses on visualizing one object but allows switching targets at any time.

\subsection {Variables versus Objects}
In JavaScript, a variable is a storage location and an associated symbolic name which contains a value. JavaScript: The Definitive Guide \cite{Flanagan:1998:JDG:551216} introduces about data types in JavaScript. JavaScript allows you to work with three primitive data types: numbers, strings of text, and boolean truth values. JavaScript also defines two trivial data types, null and undefined, each of which defines only a single value.

In addition to these primitive types, JavaScript also supports a composite data type known as object. Just like other object-oriented programming languages, an object in JavaScript is composed of a collection of values with either primitive values or objects. An object can represent an unordered collection of named values or an ordered collection of numbered values. The latter case is called an array. Although array is also an object, it behaves quite differently and have to be considered specially throughout the paper.

JavaScript also defines a few other specialized kinds of objects. \textbf{Function} is a subprogram that can be called externally or internally in case of recursion. \textbf{Date} creates a object that represents a single moment in time. \textbf{RegExp} creates a object that represents a regular expression for matching text with a pattern. \textbf{Error} creates a object that represent syntax or runtime errors that can occur in a JavaScript program. Because this research focuses on user-customized data structures, these four types of objects have their own specific data structures hence will not be considered any specially.

We selected object as the target to visualize. This seems trivially different from previous research like the famous data structure visualization system, jGRASP \cite{Cross:2007:DOV:1227310.1227316}, who uses variable as the target of visualization. Although there is no problem using variable in jGRASP because it is static visualization without any animation. Our research introduces animation hence the problem has tremendously changed. The fundamental difference is whether there exists substantive relationship between two consecutive states. Animation is visualizing the changes between two consecutive states, so it have to proceed on the former state. That is why variable can not be used here as the target of visualization in that even the variables with the same name may refer to different objects or go out of scope after stepping through the program. Both situations may lead to meaningless animation because original mapping relationship can not be adapted for new object with different structure.

However, variable is still used as the entry to start watching certain object. Modern debugger offers many sophisticated features such as stepping through the program, stopping at some event by means of breakpoint and examining the current state such as tracking the values of variables and stack trace. We can find that typical debugging prefer examining variable values to exploring snapshot of the heap. Therefore, we choose variable as the entry and the object referred by the variable will drive the following animation.

\begin {figure} \centering
  \includegraphics [width=1.0\linewidth] {img/select-object}
  \caption {Select variable named array to visualize}
  \label {fig: Select variable named array to visualize}
\end {figure}

\begin {figure} \centering
  \includegraphics [width=1.0\linewidth] {img/select-object-after}
  \caption {Variable named array has been visualized}
  \label {fig: Variable named array has been visualized}
\end {figure}

Figure \ref{fig: Select variable named array to visualize} shows the system interface. The left half is the visualization view. Users can select some object to visualize by means of inputting its variable name and click the button with add icon on the top right corner and then you can see that object has been visualized as a bar chart in Figure \ref{fig: Variable named array has been visualized}.

\subsection {User Interest}
As Niklaus Wirth said in his book \cite{Wirth:1978:ADS:540029}, Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs, which means that we have to understand algorithms and data structures before understanding programs. Although our research is based on data structure visualization, we also intend to help users understand algorithms as far as possible. Although the attention has to be focused on one object, we still can help users understand algorithms from two aspects:
\begin {enumerate}
\item \textbf{Animation} displays how algorithms contribute to the object modification
\item \textbf{Highlighted shapes} represent the objects that users are interested in
\end {enumerate}

In Figure \ref{fig: Context Visualization}, we can see that two bars are highlighted with red border against Figure \ref{fig: Variable named array has been visualized}. Users can input arbitrary number of variables split by commas in the top left corner of the visualization view. Any object referred by any inputted variable and possessing the same handle with any visual object will be highlighted with red border. Unlike that the target object being visualized is locked, these variables will be evaluated each step because they stand for how current environment relates with the target object.

\end {figure}

\subsection {Mapping Mechanism}
\label {Mapping Mechanism}
Object graph details the relationships between objects. The object graph of the root object is defined as \(G = (V, E)\). Here, the vertex set $V$ represents all objects referred by the root object either directly or indirectly, and the edge set $E$ represents the reference relationships between those objects. Figure \ref{fig: JavaScript Object Graph} shows an example of JavaScript object graph.

\begin {figure} \centering
  \includegraphics [width=1.0\linewidth] {img/object-graph}
  \caption {JavaScript object graph}
  \label {fig: JavaScript Object Graph}
\end {figure}

Traversing the object graph according to the next actions, we will get a subgraph of it, \(G_s = (V_s, E_s)\). The whole object graph probably contains much information that users are not interested in, hence we extract a subgraph from the whole object graph. All of the objects in the subgraph serve the visualization work, so we call them visual objects here.

After, each visual object is responsible to create its own visual shapes. We called them visual nodes here. Each data structure defines its own visual nodes. In this paper, we have implemented two data structures, bar chart and tree.

Bar chart only has one type of visual node. All visual nodes are connected into one list. The bars will be displayed in the same order of the list elements. The data structure of the visual node is defined as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
{
  "value": <number>,
  "id"   : <string>
}
\end{lstlisting}

Property value is displayed via the bar height. Property id is a GUID representing the identification of visual node. If the visual nodes are created by objects, their id is set as the object handle. As for the visual nodes created by primitive type values, their id is set as their index in the list. 

Tree has two types of visual nodes, node and edge. Their data structure are defined as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
{
  "label": <string>,
  "id"   : <string>,
  "type" : "node"
}
\end{lstlisting}

Node type visual node is displayed as a rectangle and property label can be seen inside. Like the visual node defined above, property id is also a GUID representing the identification of the visual node. For the visual nodes created by objects, their id is set as the object handles. For the visual nodes created by primitive type values, they must be leaf nodes in that there is no objects to traverse further. Their id is made up of three parts: the id of the adjacent node, the value of property label, and their index in the children node list. When the sibling nodes are also created by primitive type values, the latter two parts can be used to distinguish the visual nodes from their sibling nodes.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
{
  "from": <node type visual node>,
  "to"  : <node type visual node>,
  "id"  : <string>,
  "type": "edge"
}
\end{lstlisting}

Edge type visual node is displayed as an undirected line linking two node type visual nodes, namely property from and property to. Property id has just the same meaning defined before. It is set as the id of the visual node expressed by property to in that the child node is always unique in a tree. 

The visual nodes of the tree data structure can be defined as a graph, \(G^\prime = (V^\prime, E^\prime)\). The vertex set represents all visual nodes of tree node. \(V_s\) can be mapped to \(V^\prime\) by a bijective function \(f:V_s\rightarrow V^\prime\). The edge set represents all visual nodes of tree edge. \(E_s\) also can be mapped to \(E^\prime\) by a bijective function \(f:E_s\rightarrow E^\prime\).

Figure \ref{fig: Mapping Process} shows the whole mapping process starting from the root object.

\begin {figure} \centering
  \includegraphics [width=1.0\linewidth] {img/mapping-mechanism}
  \caption {Mapping process}
  \label {fig: Mapping Process}
\end {figure}

\subsection {Animate Data Structures}

After establishing the mapping relationship, we will be able to generate the animation. Animation is driven by data modifications, which is contributed by JavaScript program execution. Therefore, what we need to prove is the consistency between data modifications and animation. Figure \ref{fig: Animation Generation Process} shows the whole process of animation generation.

\begin {figure} \centering
  \includegraphics [width=1.0\linewidth] {img/consistency}
  \caption {Animation generation process}
  \label {fig: Animation Generation Process}
\end {figure}

The first step of proof is to enumerate all of the situations of data modifications and animation, and then data modifications can be translated to animation. Here, data is the visual nodes that have been explained above.

Data structure bar chart has following situations of data modifications:
\begin {enumerate}
\item A visual node with a new id was added to the list.
\item The index of some visual node with an existed id was updated.
\item A visual node with an existed id was removed from the list.
\item The property value of some visual node with an existed id was updated.
\end {enumerate}

They can be translated to following animations on the bar chart representation:
\begin {enumerate}
\item The former three situations will contribute to recalculation of the layout. Those bars with either new size or position will be resized and translated smoothly.
\item The last situation will contribute to the update of bar height.
\end {enumerate}

Data structure tree has following situations of data modifications:
\begin {enumerate}
\item A node type visual node with a new id was added.
\item A node type visual node with an existed id was removed.
\item Either the property from or to of some edge type visual node with an existed id was updated.
\item The property label of some node type visual node with an existed id was updated.
\end {enumerate}

They can be translated to following animations on the tree representation:
\begin {enumerate}
\item The former three situations will contribute to recalculation of the layout. Those nodes and edges with new positions will be translated smoothly.
\item The last situation will contribute to the update of label text.
\end {enumerate}
