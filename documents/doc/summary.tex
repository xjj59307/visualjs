We proposed that both command-line debuggers and modern IDEs are based on character-based expressions evaluation.

\section {Future Work}
First, the system handles only one data structure at the same time. However, data structures designed by real-world softwares are usually more complicated. Fore example, one container object is defined in list structure, and each element of the list is defined in tree structure, whose node is a user-defined data structure. These kinds of compound data structures can not be handled by current system.

Some common system enhancements could be some help. For example, the system supports only two data structures, tree and bar chart, on the current stage. More data structures need to be covered before the system could be used to debug practical programs.

Finally, system's effectiveness in terms of helping programmers understand programs, must be evaluated with practical users. Especially, whether and how much our system could simplify and accelerate the debugging process should be examined.
