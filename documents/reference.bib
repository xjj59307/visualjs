Textbooks and courses on data structures these days are programming-languages-based with those based on object-oriented programming (OOP) in dominance. In many cases, they base their pedagogy on software design patterns. However, because of heavy reliance on abstraction, they place greater demands on learners. In this study, we design and implement a visualization tool that makes it easier for students to understand object-oriented data structures.},

@article{Caserta2010,
abstract = {Software is usually complex and always intangible. In practice, the development and maintenance processes are time-consuming activities mainly because software complexity is difficult to manage. Graphical visualization of software has the potential to result in a better and faster understanding of its design and functionality, saving time and providing valuable information to improve its quality. However, visualizing software is not an easy task because of the huge amount of information comprised in the software. Furthermore, the information content increases significantly once the time dimension to visualize the evolution of the software is taken into account. Human perception of information and cognitive factors must thus be taken into account to improve the understandability of the visualization. In this paper, we survey visualization techniques, both 2D- and 3D-based, representing the static aspects of the software and its evolution. We categorize these techniques according to the issues they focus on, in order to help compare them and identify the most relevant techniques and tools for a given problem.},

A good visual animation is both a technical artifact and a work of art that can greatly enhance the understanding of an algorithm's workings. In the first part of the paper, I show that awareness of the composition principles used by other animators and visual artists can help programmers to create better algorithmic animations. The second part shows how to incorporate those ideas in novel animation systems, which represent data structures in a visually intuitive manner.

abstract = {Based on research into learning programming and a review of program visualization research, we designed an educational software tool that aims to target students' apparent fragile knowledge of elementary programming which manifests as difficulties in tracing and writing even simple programs. Most existing tools build on a single supporting technology and focus on one aspect of learning. For example, visualization tools support the development of a conceptual-level understanding of how programs work, and automatic assessment tools give feedback on submitted tasks. We implemented a combined tool that closely integrates programming tasks with visualizations of program execution and thus lets students practice writing code and more easily transition to visually tracing it in order to locate programming errors. In this paper we present Jype, a web-based tool that provides an environment for visualizing the line-by-line execution of Python programs and for solving programming exercises with support for immediate automatic feedback and an integrated visual debugger. Moreover, the debugger allows stepping back in the visualization of the execution as if executing in reverse. Jype is built for Python, when most research in programming education support tools revolves around Java.},

abstract = {Pedagogical algorithm animation systems produce graphical representations that aim to assist learners in understanding the dynamic behavior of computer algorithms. In order to foster active learning, educators have explored algorithm animation systems that empower learners to construct their own animations of algorithms under study. Notably, these systems support a similar development model in which coding the algorithm is temporally distinct from viewing and interacting with the resulting visualization. Given that novice learners are known to lack robust mental models of how code executes, they would especially stand to benefit from a more dynamic programming model that narrows the gap between coding an algorithm and viewing its visualization. We have implemented \&amp;x201C;What You See Is What You Code\&amp;x201D;, a novel, \&amp;x201C;radically dynamic\&amp;x201D; programming model to facilitate learner-constructed algorithm animations in our Preliminary Framework of the Language System. In this model, the line of algorithm code currently being edited is re-evaluated on every edit, leading to the dynamic update of an accompanying animation of the algorithm. The immediacy of the model's feedback can help novices to quickly identify and correct programming errors, and ultimately to understand their code's execution.},

Its main goal is to enhance, simplify and clarify the mental representation a software engineer has of a computer system. During many years, visualization in 2D space has been actively studied, but in the last decade, researchers have begun to explore new 3D representations for visualizing software. In this article, we present an overview of current research in the area, describing several major aspects like: visual representations, interaction issues, evaluation methods and development tools. We also perform a survey of some representative tools to support different tasks, i.e., software maintenance and comprehension, requirements validation and algorithm animation for educational purposes, among others. Finally, we conclude identifying future research directions.},
